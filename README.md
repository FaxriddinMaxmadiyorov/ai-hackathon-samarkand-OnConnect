## About OnConnect

In Uzbekistan, 15,000 people receive cancer diagnoses annually. Unfortunately, most of these patients never access world-class oncological expertise that could save their lives. Central Asia, with a population of 75 million, suffers from severely limited access to specialized cancer care.

**OnConnect** is a second medical opinion platform connecting patients with oncological diseases to expert doctors worldwide.

---

## Main Feature

OnConnect recommends doctors by analyzing both:

- Comprehensive data on doctors globally  
- Individual patient data, including general info (age, sex, etc.), diagnosed disease, and clinical test results  

---

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the source code for a **Telegram bot** that collects patient data and interacts with a large language model (LLM). The LLM uses both patient and doctor data to provide personalized doctor recommendations.

**Note:** Currently, the system works with synthetic doctor data only.

---

## Usage

Instructions on how to run the Telegram bot and integrate with the LLM will be added soon.
